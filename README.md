Data and code for:
*Grant, Krishnan, and Bradbury. 2021. Conservation risks and benefits of establishing monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) breeding habitat in close proximity to maize and soybean fields in the North Central U.S.: A landscape-scale analysis of foliar insecticide impacts on non-migratory monarch butterfly populations. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management.* Accepted as of February 22, 2021. 

In this repository are:
  * Geographic Information System shapefiles of Story County for Scenarios 1-4. These shapefiles were used in the Repast Simphony agent-based model.
  * R code to process the agent-based model output (ToxSims.R). 
  * Data and code for analyzing monarch field count data to estimate natural survival. StageSurvival.R is the R code. The two .bug files are the runjags model files with and without informative priors. 
  * R code for the demographic model that simulates/projects population size/production is in MonarchPopProjectionForGitHub.R.
  * The toxicology data can be obtained by consulting *Krishnan N, Yang Z, Bidne KG, Hellmich RL, Coats JR, and Bradbury SP. 2020. Assessing field‐scale risks of foliar insecticide applications to monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) larvae. Environ Toxicol Chem 39 (4): 923–41.* and the data repository documented there.
